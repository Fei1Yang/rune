# Contributing

Welcome to the Rune project! We appreciate your interest in contributing. Please follow these guidelines to ensure smooth collaboration.

## Language

All contributions must be in English. This ensures clear communication among developers from diverse backgrounds and regions, fostering efficient collaboration and minimizing misunderstandings. If you're not confident in your English, we encourage you to use any large language model to assist you.

## Features

- **No Feature Requests**: As Rune is in its early development phase, we are not accepting feature requests. However, contributions are welcome.
- **Implementing Features**: Please contact the development team for a preliminary discussion to ensure alignment with Rune's vision.

## Pull Requests

- **Language**: English is the sole language for collaboration. We do not accept pull requests for translating the README or any development documentation.
- **Commits**: Use clear and descriptive commit messages. Please follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

## Issues

When reporting issues, please follow these guidelines to help us address your problem efficiently:

### Check for Existing Issues

- Before opening a new issue, search the [existing issues](https://github.com/losses/rune/issues) to see if your problem has already been reported.
- If you find a similar issue, consider adding a üëç reaction instead of a "+1" comment.

### Specify the Version

- Indicate which version(s) of *Rune* the issue occurs in.

### Steps to Reproduce

- List the steps needed to reproduce the issue. This helps us understand how to encounter the problem:
  1. Describe the actions taken with the client.
  2. Note the error or problem observed.

### Include Logs

- Provide a full **debug** log.
- Ensure the log covers the steps to reproduce the issue.
- Format the log as code or use a non-expiring [pastebin](https://pastebin.com/).
- Redact personal data but do not remove or trim other information.

### Host Information

- Include details about the system running `Rune`:
  - OS (e.g., NixOS 24.05.20240830.6e99f2a)
