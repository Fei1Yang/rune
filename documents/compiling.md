## Tips for Compiling on macOS

Rune currently does not support macOS, but here are some tips for attempting compilation:

- Ensure you have the Flutter SDK and Rust toolchain installed.
- For [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/), avoid using the default macOS Ruby version. Use Homebrew instead:

  ```bash
  brew install cocoapods
  ```
